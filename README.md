My solutions for <http://adventofcode.com/> as I go, in either Ruby (if I just want to get it done) or Elixir (if I want to play).

My Advent of Code philosophy: make it work, then move on. So expect brute-force solutions and mostly unfactored code.

I love elegant solutions and clean code, but this is not where I practise those… 🔫🏇
